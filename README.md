# Basketball Kid

## An NBA Statistical Tracking App:

Ten-year-old me would spend hours poring over NBA box scores in the newspaper each day. This app is intended as a way for all the ten-year-old basketball kids out there to pull up virtual basketball cards about their favorite active players.

Basic goals:

- View player statistics by season, game, career, or narrower searches
- View team statistics by season, game, or narrower searches
- Users will interact with the app by choosing a team, then selecting a player, then viewing a list of biodata and statistics about them.

With further development:

- Build fantasy teams of your favorite players and have the team storage persist through multiple games or a season
- Include player and team information from multiple leagues, including the WNBA, FIBA, Euro leagues, etc.
- Build dynamic statistical lists and/or tables.

Technologies:

- React Native (mobile/web app)
- NodeJS

API technology used: 'nba' npm module that installs a node.js client to serve up stats.nba.com/stats endpoints
