# Basketball Kid

## An NBA Statistical Tracking App:

Ten-year-old me would spend hours poring over NBA box scores in the newspaper each day. This app is a way for all the ten-year-old basketball kids out there to find out information about their favorite players.

(Specific information available will depend on the specific API I'm working with)

Basic goals:

- View player statistics by season, game, career, or narrower searches
- View team statistics by season, game, or narrower searches
- Users will interact with the app using a search bar at the top to find different types of information. I think I will need to include a dropdown to specify the type of search (player, season, stat category) and endpoint used.

Stretch goals:

- Build fantasy teams of your favorite players and have the team storage persist through multiple games or a season
- Include player and team information from multiple leagues, including the WNBA, FIBA, Euro leagues, etc.
- Users will interact with the app using a search bar at the top to find different types of information. I think I will need to include a dropdown to specify the type of search (player, season, stat category) and endpoint used. Stretch:

Technologies:

- React Native (mobile/web app)
- Express server
- Mongo DB

API technology used: 'nba' npm module that installs a node.js client to serve up stats.nba.com/stats endpoints (free, but may have issues with cloud hosting)
